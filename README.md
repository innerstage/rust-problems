# Rust Problems
A set of 89 problems that helped me learn C, but solved in Rust instead. I'll add them in separate folders and update the objective of each problem as I solve them.

## 01. "Hello World"
Create a program in Rust that prints:
Hello world!
There must be a carriage return at the end (\n).
