# Rust Problems
A set of 89 problems that helped me learn C, but solved in Rust instead. I'll add them in separate folders and write down the objective of each problem as I solve them.

These problems were created by my programming languages professor at uni, Jorge LÃ³pez Reguera, for his [automated learning support platform](http://pa3p.inf.udec.cl/C/CENTRO_EVALUADOR/) which would take your code in C and check it.

## 01. "Hello World"
Write a program in Rust that prints:
```
Hello world!
```
There must be a carriage return at the end (\n).

## 02. "Hello World" ten times
Write a program in Rust that prints 10 times:
```
Hello world!
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of each line.

## 03. Print integers from 1 to 10, on one line
Create a program in Rust that prints:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of the line.

## 04. Print integers from 1 to 10, one on each line
Create a program in Rust that prints:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of each line.

## 05. Print integers from 1 to 100, one on each line
Create a program in Rust that prints integers from 1 to 100 in the following way:`
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
.
.
.
100
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of each line.

## 06. Print integers as a triangle
Create a program in Rust that prints:`
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of each line.

## 07. Print integers as an arrowhead
Create a program in Rust that prints:
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
6 6 6 6 6 6
5 5 5 5 5
4 4 4 4
3 3 3
2 2
1
```
There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end of each line.

## 08. Print the content of an integer variable
Write a program in Rust that prints the number contained in a global integer variable called x.

## 09. Print the content of an integer variable and its five predecessors.
Write a program in Rust that prints the number contained in a global integer variable called x and its five predecessors.

## 10. Print the content of three integer variables
Write a program in Rust that print the numbers contained in three integer global variables named x, w and z.

Example of the output:
x: 16, w: 13, z: 20

There must be a carriage return (\n) at the end.
